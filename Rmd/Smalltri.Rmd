Suppose you have a triangle in Excel that you would like to
analyze in R.
In Excel, select the cells comprising the triangle
*including the labels identifying accident year and age*
and copy to the clipboard.

[//]: # ![Smalltri](Smalltri.png) 

<img src='smalltri.png' width="400px">

Back in R,
load the excelRio package and
run the function that pastes content
from the clipboard.
Be sure to tell the function that your
data has a "header" for the column names
and a "rowheader" for the row names.

```{r}
library(excelRio)
tri <- pasteFromExcel(header = TRUE, rowheader = TRUE)
tri
```

Note: The clipboard is a text-oriented storage facility.
When copying cell content to the clipboard from Excel,
what actually gets copied is the character representation
of the cell content as displayed on the screen.
Normally, the dollar signs and commas in the numbers 
would not allow R to
convert the character data to numeric,
as below the first two character values become NA.
```{r}
as.numeric(c("$1,000", "1,200", "800"))
```

But excelRio looks to see if 
the contents can be converted to numeric without such
"adornments,"
and does the conversion if possible.
