Suppose you have a triangle in Excel that you would like to analyze in R. In Excel, select the cells comprising the triangle *including the labels identifying accident year and age* and copy to the clipboard.

[//]: # ![Smalltri](Smalltri.png) 

<img src='smalltri.png' width="400px">

Back in R, load the **excelRio** package and run the function that pastes content from the clipboard. Be sure to tell the function that your data has a "header" for the column names (development ages) and a "rowheader" for the row names (accident years).

```{r}
library(excelRio)
tri <- pasteFromExcel(header = TRUE, rowheader = TRUE)
tri
```


**excelRio** has special handling to strip out the dollar signs and commas when appropriate. **excelRio**'s interpretation of "appropriate" is, if after stripping out the dollar signs and commas the column of results can be successfully converted to **numeric**, then that's what will happen. Without special handling, this would not normally happen, as below when the first two character elements lose numeric value.

```{r}
as.numeric(c("$1,000", "1,200", "800"))
```


The argument that controls this special handling is **convertFormattedNumbers** and can be turned off, as in the code below. Note that I also set **stringsAsFactors = FALSE** because my installation of **R** has the default value TRUE for that global option.

```{r}
tri <- pasteFromExcel(header = TRUE, rowheader = TRUE, 
                      convertFormattedNumbers = FALSE, 
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
tri
mode(tri)
class(tri)
```

The *class* of the above raises a subtle point about the value of the result from **pasteFromExcel**. 

Data in Excel is often comprised of columns of data of many different types: numeric, character, and dates, to name a few. By default, therefore, **pasteFromExcel** will create a data.frame, an **R** object that allows differently typed columns. But when all the columns of data are "compatible," **pasteFromExcel** will return a matrix object of the common "type" (or "mode") by default, if possible, under the assumption that a matrix object would be "intuitively expected." The argument that controls that option is **simplify**. By calling the function with **simplify = FALSE**, a data.frame will always be returned.

For more information about **pasteFromExcel** and its various optional arguments, see
```
?pasteFromExcel
```

Finally, Dear Reader, I leave you with a warning and a request for assistance! :)

### _Warning!_

Formatted numbers in Excel are stripped of their "adornments" via a [regular expression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) I found on the internet [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/354044/what-is-the-best-u-s-currency-regex). **This expression will not work outside the U.S.** 

I repeat: 

***Warning! excelRio's special currency handling will only work with dollar signs, with periods as decimal separator, and with commas separating triples.*** I apologize. :(  

(For the curious, **excelRio** stores its current regex pattern for currency in the variable **currencypattern** on line 38 in the file **excelRio.r** in the R folder of the package on github. )

### _Request for Assistance!_

If anyone is interested in suggesting a currency pattern for their location I would really appreciate the collaboration --- woohoo!! You can reach me at danielmarkmurphy at gmail. Thank you sincerely in advance.
